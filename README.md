## Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical metric for businesses, especially subscription-based services. This project aims to predict churn based on customer data using a machine learning approach. 

The project workflow includes:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for data understanding.
2. Data preprocessing to clean and prepare the dataset.
3. Building and training a neural network to classify churn outcomes.
4. Evaluating model performance to ensure accuracy and reliability.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains customer information such as:
- **Demographics**: Gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents.
- **Services**: PhoneService, MultipleLines, InternetService, StreamingTV, etc.
- **Account Information**: Tenure, Contract Type, Payment Method, Monthly and Total Charges.
- **Churn**: Binary indicator of whether the customer has churned.

**Dataset Summary**:
- **Rows**: 7,043
- **Columns**: 21
- No missing or duplicate values were found.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**:
  - Data Processing: `pandas`, `numpy`
  - Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
  - Machine Learning: `TensorFlow`, `Keras`

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**:
   - Load the dataset.
   - Handle missing values and incorrect data types.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Understand distributions and correlations.
   - Visualize features affecting churn.
3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Normalize and encode categorical data.
   - Prepare the dataset for neural network input.
4. **Model Building**:
   - A 3-layer neural network with `relu` activation.
   - Binary cross-entropy as the loss function.
5. **Training and Evaluation**:
   - Train the model on the dataset for 100 epochs.
   - Evaluate model accuracy and loss.

## Model Architecture
The neural network architecture:
- **Input Layer**: 23 features.
- **Hidden Layers**: 
  - First layer: 23 neurons, ReLU activation.
  - Second layer: 15 neurons, ReLU activation.
- **Output Layer**: 1 neuron, Sigmoid activation.
- **Optimizer**: Adam with default learning rate.
- **Loss Function**: Binary Crossentropy.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/customer-churn-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd customer-churn-prediction
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the notebook or Python script.

---

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset (`customer_churn.csv`).
2. Load the notebook or script.
3. Train the model using:
   ```python
   model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100)
   ```
4. Evaluate the model and use it to predict churn probabilities.

---

## Results
The model achieves **[Add Accuracy Here]%** accuracy after training for 100 epochs. Further optimization can be done by tuning hyperparameters or applying additional feature engineering.
